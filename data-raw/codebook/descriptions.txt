# Data on Commissions

This dataset includes data on Commissions of the European Union (1958-2021). There is one observation per Commission. The data indicates the national party and European political group of the President of the Commission and the start and end dates of each Commission. The Mansholt Commission is treated as its own Commission. The Mar√≠n Commission is treated as part of the Santer Commission.

# Data on departments

This dataset includes data on departments of the Commission, including Directorates-General and service departments (1958-2021). There is one observation per unique department. A new observation is created every time a department is renamed, even if the department itself does not change. This allows you to track changes in department nomenclature over time. 

# Data on departments (by Commission)

This dataset includes data on departments of the Commission, including Directorates-General and service departments (1958-2021). There is one observation per department per Commission. This dataset provides a snapshot of each Commission at the time that the first directory is published. For Commissions that come into office early in a year, the first directory is usually published later that year. For Commissions that come into office late in a year, the first directory is usually published early the next year. The exception is the Prodi Commission. The data for this Commission comes from the earliest available directory. 

# Data on Commissioners

This dataset includes data on Commissioners (1958-2021). There is one observation per individual who has served as a Commissioner. The dataset indicates the national party and European political group of each individual, the Commissions that the individual served during, and the earliest and latest dates that each individual was in office. 

# Data on Commissioners (by Commission)

This dataset includes data on Commissioners (1958-2021). There is one observation per individual who has served as a Commissioner per Commission. The dataset indicates the national party and European political group of each individual, the start and end dates for each individual (within each Commission), information on whether the individual served for the entire Commission, was appointed during the Commission, or left office before the end of the Commission, and whether the portfolio of the individual changed while the individual was in office. 

# Data on policy areas

This dataset includes data on policy areas covered by departments of the Commission (1958-2021). There is one observation per policy area. EUR-Lex, the Commission's official database of EU legal documents, sorts documents based on a case law directory and a directory of legal acts. There is a pre-Lisbon and post-Lisbon version of the case law directory. The dataset indicates the directory codes that correspond to each policy area according to each of these classification schemes. 

# Data on portfolio allocations

This dataset includes data on portfolio allocations (1958-2021). There is one observation per portfolio allocation per Commission (i.e., one observation per portfolio per Commissioner per Commission). A new observation is created every time the portfolio of a Commissioner changes, regardless of whether that change results in a change in the departments that the Commissioner oversees. There can be multiple observations per individual per Commission if an individual's portfolio changes during the Commission. Portfolio allocations do not span Commissions. If a Commissioner has the same portfolio for more than one Commission, there will be multiple observations, one for each Commission. The dataset indicates the start and end dates of each portfolio allocation, the departments that each Commissioner oversees, and the policy areas that correspond to those departments.

# Data on department allocations

This dataset includes data on department allocations (1958-2021). There is one observation per department allocation per Commission (i.e., one observation per department per Commissioner per Commission). A new observation is created every time a change in the portfolio of a Commissioner leads to a change in who oversees a department. There can be multiple observations per individual per Commission if an individual oversees multiple departments or if the individual's portfolio changes during the Commission. Department allocations do not span Commissions. If a Commissioner oversees the same department for more than one Commission, there will be multiple observations, one for each Commission. The dataset indicates the start and end dates of each department allocation and the policy areas that correspond to each department. 

# Data on policy area allocations

This dataset includes data on policy area allocations (1958-2021). There is one observation per policy area allocation per Commission (i.e., one observation per policy area per Commissioner per Commission). A new observation is created every time a change in the portfolio of a Commissioner leads to a change in who oversees a policy area. There can be multiple observations per individual per Commission if an individual oversees multiple policy areas or if the individual's portfolio changes during the Commission. Policy area allocations do not span Commissions. If a Commissioner oversees a policy area for more than one Commission, there will be multiple observations, one for each Commission. The dataset indicates the start and end dates of each policy allocation.

# Data on department histories

This dataset includes data on the histories of the current departments of the Commission, including Directorates-General and service departments (1958-2021). There is one observation per historical interval in which the nomenclature of a department is constant. Unlike allocations, intervals can span Commissions. By sorting the dataset by current department, you can see the evolution of each department over time. The dataset indicates the Commissions associated with each interval and the start and end dates of each interval. 

# Data on policy area histories

This dataset includes data on the histories of the policy areas covered by the departments of the Commission (1958-2021). There is one observation per historical interval in which the mapping between a policy area and a department is constant. If the nomenclature of a department changes, a new interval will be created. Unlike allocations, intervals can span Commissions. There can also be multiple overlaping intervals per policy area when a policy area is split across multiple departments at the same time. By sorting the dataset by policy area, you can see the evolution of the mapping between the policy area and departments over time. The dataset indicates the Commissions associated with each interval and the start and end dates of each interval. 

# Data on classification schemes

This dataset includes data on the classification schemes used by EUR-Lex, the Commission's official database of EU legal documents. EUR-Lex sorts documents based on a case law directory and a directory of legal acts. There is a pre-Lisbon and post-Lisbon version of the case law directory. Each directory has major codes and minor codes. There is one observation per minor code per classification scheme. The dataset indicates the policy area (if any) that best corresponds to each minor code.
