# ecio

An `R` package for the European Commission Internal Organization (ECIO) Database. The ECIO Database includes 12 datasets on the European Commission (1958-2021), including data on Commissioners (including their national parties and European political groups), departments (including Directorates-General and service departments), portfolio allocations (i.e., the portfolio of each Commissioner), department allocations (i.e., which Commissioner was responsible for each department), and policy area allocations (which Commissioner was responsible for various policy areas). It also includes data on the historical evolution of Commission departments and on the mapping of policy areas to departments. The datasets are primarily hand-coded based on information from the official directories of the Commission and other official sources.
