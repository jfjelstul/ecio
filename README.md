# ecio

An `R` package for the European Commission Internal Organization (ECIO) Database. The ECIO Database includes 12 datasets on on the European Commission, including data on historical Commissions, Commissioners (including their national parties and European political groups), departments (Directorates-General and service departments), portfolio allocations (i.e., the portfolio of each Commissioner), department allocations (i.e., which Commissioner was responsible for each department), and policy area allocations (which Commissioner was responsible for each policy area). It also includes data on the histories of Commission departments and on the mapping of policy areas to departments. The datasets cover the period from 1958 through 2021 and are primarily hand-coded based on information from the official directories of the Commission.
